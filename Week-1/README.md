### Step 2 - Complete the Assignment
By completing this assignment, you will learn to:
1. Build and understand linear regression.
2. Analyse data properly.
3. Detect and measure bias in ML models.
4. Apply bias mitigation techniques and justify them responsibly.
5. Build a neural network in PyTorch and train it end-to-end.

Ensure that the solutions are detailed. Make sure the report includes the proper solutions, required code and include all relevant plots, explanations and corresponding output.
