# Week 2 – Kalman Filtering for Trading

## Goal  
The goal of this learning module is to build a solid theoretical and practical foundation in Kalman Filters, with an emphasis on their application to financial time series and trading strategies. Learners will understand how Kalman Filters model noisy observations and estimate latent variables such as fair value, trend, volatility, and dynamic relationships. The module aims to bridge intuition, mathematics, and implementation by enabling participants to confidently apply Kalman Filters in Python. By the end of the module, learners will be able to interpret model outputs, evaluate assumptions, and assess the suitability of Kalman Filter–based methods in real trading environments.

## What You Will Learn
By the end of the week, you will understand the mathematical foundations of Kalman filtering, including state-space models, prediction–update equations, and covariance dynamics. You will learn how to implement one-dimensional and multi-dimensional Kalman Filters in Python and apply them to estimate trends, volatility, and dynamic relationships in financial data. You will also gain hands-on experience using Kalman Filters for trading applications such as mean-reversion, trend estimation, and dynamic regression, along with an understanding of their limitations and practical considerations.

### Assignment
#### By completing this assignment, you will be able to: 
    - Model non-stationary financial time series using Kalman Filters instead of static assumptions
    - Formulate and implement a state-space model for real market data
    - Use practical feature engineering for financial markets and understanding which features carry predictive power
    - Integrate machine learning with probabilistic filtering (Kalman-filtered states → ML prediction)
    - Design causal, leakage-free trading signals suitable for real backtesting
    - Build a complete end-to-end trading pipeline: data → model → signals → PnL
    - Implement and interpret backtesting metrics like Sharpe ratio and drawdown
    - Understand the gap between predictive accuracy and trading profitability
    - Develop intuition for risk management and robustness in systematic strategies
